```python
The dataset we are using for our project is the ADPD dataset also known as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease dataset.It has 1439 attributes and 199 entries. 
The first attribute represents the gene names and the following attributes represent the gene experimental values of patients. 
The dataset was made from a congregation of multiple gene based datasets including Common Genes Alzheimer Parkinson(CGAP), brain tumore and glioblastoma. 
All these datasets were downloaded from Biolabs Data Set Repository which stores both experimental values and gene names.
